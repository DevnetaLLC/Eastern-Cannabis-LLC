### Section 2.2 - Equal Employment & Americans with Disabilities

It is our policy to provide equal employment opportunities to all _employees_ and _employment applicants_ without regard to unlawful considerations of race,
religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information,
marital status, or any other classification protected by applicable _local_, _state_, or _federal_ laws. <br />

This policy prohibits unlawful discrimination based on the perception that anyone has any of those characteristics, or is associated with a person who has or
is perceived to having any of those characteristics. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including but not limited to, hiring, job assignment, working conditions, compensation, promotion, benefits,
> scheduling, training, discipline, and termination. <br />

We expect all employees to support our equal employment policy, to take all steps necessary to maintain a workplace free from unlawful discrimination and harassment
and to accommodate others in line with this policy to the **_fullest extent_** required by law.

> For example, we will make reasonable accommodations for employee's observance of religious holidays and practices unless the accommodation would cause an undue hardship on our operations.

> [!NOTE]
> If you desire a religious accommodation, you are required to make the request in writing to our Management department as far in advance as possible.

You are expected to strive to find co-workers who can assist in the accommodation (e.g., trade shifts) and cooperate with us in seeking and evaluating alternatives. <br />

Moreover, in compliance with the **__Americans with Disabilities_** ("**_ADA_**"), we provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities to the
**_fullest extent_** required by law. We may require _medical certification_ of both the _disability_ and _the need for accommodation_.

> [!WARNING]
> Keep in mind, that we only seek to accommodate the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual. Therefore, it is your
> responsibility to come forward if you are in need of accommodation.

> [!NOTE]
> We will engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify possible accommodations if any will help the applicant or employee perform the job.

### Section 2.3 - Confidentiality

In the course of employment with Eastern Cannabis LLC, employees may have access to _Confidential Information_ regarding the Company, which may
include its business strategy, future plans, financial plans, contracts, suppliers, customers, personnel information, or other information that the
Company considers proprietary and confidential. <br />

Maintaining the confidentiality of this information is vital to our competitive position in the industry and, ultimately, to its ability to achieve financial
success and stability. Employees must protect this information by safeguarding it when in use, using it only for the business of the Company, and disclosing
it only when authorized to do so and to those who have an legitimate business need to know about it. <br />

This duty of confidentiality applies whether the employee is on or off our premises, and during and even after the end of the employee's employment with
the Company. This duty of confidentiality also applies to communications transmitted by our electronic communications. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As a condition of employment with us, all employees must sign a **Non-Disclosure Agreement**.

### Section 2.4 - Employment of Minors

The **FLSA**'s child labor provisions, which we strictly adhere to, are designed to protect the educational opportunities of youth and prohibit their employment
in jobs that are detrimental to their health and safety. <br />

Due to the nature of Eastern Cannabis LLC's daily operations, we prohibit the employment of minors for most positions. We occasionally review the employment
of minors on a case-by-case basis. <br />

### Section 2.5 - Employment of Relatives

We recognize that the employment of relatives in certain circumstances, such as when they work in the same department, supervise or manage the other, or
have access to confidential or sensitive information regarding the other, cause problems related to supervision, safety, security, or morale, or create
conflicts of interest that materially and substantially disrupt our operations. <br />

When we determine any of these problems will be present, it will decline to hire an individual to work in the same department as a relative. <br />

> [!NOTE]
> Relatives subject to this policy include: father, mother, sister, brother, current spouse or domestic partner, child (natural, foster, or adopted),
> current mother-in-law, current father-in-law, grandparent, or grand child.

If present employees have become relatives during employment, we should be notified so that we may determine whether a problem involving supervision,
safety, security, morale, or a conflict of interest that would materially and substantially disrupt our operations exists. If we determine such a problem
exists, we will take appropriate steps to resolve the problem, which may include reassignment of one relative (if feasible) or asking the resignation of one of
the relatives.

### Section 2.6 - Introductory Period

The first **180 days** of employment are considered an _introductory period_ for all newly hired employees. <br />

During this time, you will learn your new responsibilities, get acquainted with fellow employees, and determine whether you are happy with the positions.
Also, during this time, the Management department will monitor your performance. Upon completion of the _introductory period_, the management department
will review your performance. If we find your performance satisfactory and decide to continue your employment, you will be advised of any improvements expected.
This is also an opportunity for you to make suggestions to improve our efficiency and operations. <br />

Completion of the _introductory period_ **does not** entitle you to remain employed by Eastern Cannabis LLC for any definite period of time, but instead
allows both you and us to evaluate whether you are right for the position. Your status as an at-will employee does not change the employment
relationship may be terminated with or without cause and with or without advance notice, at any time by you or the Company. 

### Section 2.7 - Personnel Records and Employee References

If you are pregnant, recovering from childbirth, or have a pregnancy-related medical condition, you have the right to breastfeeding accommodations in the workplace. <br />

Under the _Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers_ ("_PUMP_") Act, employers are required to provide: <br />
    + Reasonable break time for you to express breast milk for your nursing child as needed; and, <br />
    + A lactation space, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public. <br />

These accommodations must be provided for **one (1) year** after the child's birth and be available each time an employee needs them. <br />

Additionally under the _Pregnant Workers Fairness Act_ ("_PWFA_"), covered employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations to a worker's
known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Under the _PWFA_, your employer cannot: <br />
    + Require you to accept an accommodation without a discussion about the accommodation between you and your employer; <br />
    + Deny a job or other employment opportunities to you based on your need for reasonable accommodation; <br />
    + Require you to take leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided that would let you keep working; <br />
    + Retaliate against you for reporting or opposing unlawful discrimination under the _PWFA_ or participating _PWFA_ proceeding (such as an investigation); or <br />
    + Interfere with your rights under the _PWFA_. <br />

For more information regarding your rights under the _PUMP_ Act, review the _U.S. Department of Labor Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2023-2022_. <br />
_PUMP_ Act rights are not provided to you if you are a crew-member employed by an air carrier, or if there are less than 50 employees in your organization
and such requirements would impose an undue hardship on your employer. <br />

For more information regarding your rights under _PWFA_ review the _U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guide_. <br />
_PWFA_ rights are provided to you if you work for a covered employer, including private and public sector employers with at least 15 employees, Congress,
Federal agencies, employment agencies, and labor organizations. These rights are not provided to you if such requirements would pose an undue hardship on your employers.
