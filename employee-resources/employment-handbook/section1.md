# Eastern Cannabis LLC - Employee Handbook & Policies

## Section 1 - Introduction.

### Section 1.1 - Welcome to the Eastern Cannabis LLC Team!

Welcome to Eastern Cannabis LLC. Here we specialize mainly in the cultivation
and processing of cannabis and cannabis-related materials. We were first established in 
October 2023 in New York State. <br />

### Section 1.2 - Handbook

This handbook ("Handbook") is designed to summarize certain personnel policies and benefits of Eastern Cannabis LLC ("Company", "our", "us", "we"), of all
United States locations, and to acquaint employees with many rules concerning employment. This Handbook applies to all employees, and compliance with our policies is a condition of employment. <br />

> [!WARNING]
> This Handbook supersedes all previous employment policies, written and oral, express and implied.

> [!WARNING]
> We reserve the right to modify, rescind, delete, or add to the provisions of this Handbook from time to time in our sole and absolute discretion. <br />
> We reserve the right to interpret the policies in this Handbook and to deviate from them when, in our sole discretion, we determine it is appropriate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Handbook is not a binding contract between us and our employees, nor is it intended to alter the at-will employment relationship between us and our employees.

### Section 1.3 - Changes in policy

Since our business is constantly changing, we expressly reserve the right to revise, modify, delete, or add to **any and all** policies, procedures, work rules, or benefits stated in this Handbook or in any other document, except for the policy of
[At-Will Employment]() as described below. <br />

No oral statements or representations can in any way alter the provisions of this Handbook. Nothing in this Handbook or in any other document, including benefit
plan descriptions, creates or is intended to create a promise or representation of continued employment for any employee. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any changes to your At-Will Employment status must be signed by our [Chief Executive Officer](mailto:kgarow@devneta.org).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are uncertain about any policy or procedure, please contact the Management department.

You are free to resign at any time for any reason with or without notice. Similarly, we are free to conclude the employment relationship at any time for any lawful reason,
with or without cause, and with or without notice. <br />

Nothing in this Handbook will limit the right of either party to terminate an at-will employment status. No section of this Handbook is meant to be construed,
nor should be construed, as establishing anything other than an employment-at-will relationship. <br />

> [!CAUTION]
> This Handbook does not limit Management's discretion in making personnel decisions such as reassignment, change of wages and benefits, demotions, ect. No person other than
> the Chief Executive Officer has the authority to enter into an agreement for employment for any specified period of time or to make an agreement for employment
> other than at-will terms. Only the Chief Executive Officer of Eastern Cannabis LLC has the authority to make any such agreement, which is only binding if it is
> in writing and signed by a member of our Management department.
