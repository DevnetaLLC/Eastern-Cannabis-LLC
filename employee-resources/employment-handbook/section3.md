### Section 3.5 - Payroll Deductions

### Section 3.6 - Wage Garnishment

A garnishment is a court order requiring an employer to remit part of an employee's wages to a third party to satisfy a just debt. <br />

Once we receive the legal papers ordering a garnishment, we are **required by law** to continue making deductions from your paycheck until we have withheld the full amount or we receive legal papers from the court to stop the garnishment. <br />

> [!WARNING]
> Even if you have already paid the debt, we still require the legal papers to stop the garnishment.

### Section 3.7 - Direct Deposit

All employees are encouraged, but not required, to use direct deposit and have their paychecks deposited into a bank account of an accredited participating bank or credit union. <br />
