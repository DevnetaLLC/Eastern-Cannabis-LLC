## Section 6 - Leaves of Absence and Time Off

### Section 6.1 - General

While regular attendance is crucial to maintain business operations, we recognize that, for a variety of reasons, employees may need time off from work. <br />

We have available a number of types of leaves of absence. Some are governed by law, and others are discretionary. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For all planned leaves, employees must submit a request at least **fourteen** (**14**) days in advance. In case of emergencies, employees should submit the request as soon as they become aware of the need for leave.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All leaves must have the approval of [Kyyle E. Garrow](mailto:kgarrow@devneta.org) and, or the Management department.

If during a leave, an employee accepts another job, engages in other employment or consulting outside of the Company, or applies for unemployment insurance benefits, the employee may be considered to have voluntarily resigned from employment with the Company. <br />

All requests for leave of absence will be considered in light of their effect on us and our work requirements, as determined by [Kyyle E. Garrow](mailto:kgarrow@devneta.org) and, or the Management department, which reserves the right to approve or deny requests in their sole discretion, unless otherwise required by law. <br />

> [!NOTE]
> For disability-related leave requests, we will engage in an interactive process with the employee to determine if leave is the most appropriate accommodation. <br />
> Employees must provide a certification from their healthcare provider to us to support leave for medical reasons.

> [!WARNING]
> Failure to provide the required certification to us in a timely manner will result in delay or denial of leave

If an employee requires an extension of leave, the employee must request such extension and have it approved before the expiration of the currently approved leave. <br />

_While we will make a reasonable effort to return the employee to their former position or comparable position following an approved leave of absence, there is no guarantee that the employee will be reinstated to their position, or any position, expect as required by law._ <br />

### Section 6.2 - Paid Time Off Days

Eligible employees are entitled to **twenty-one** (**21**) paid time off ("_PTO_") days per year. <br />

> [!NOTE]
> A PTO days' pay for regular [full-time employees](/employee-resources/employment-handbook/section2.md#full-time-employees) will be calculated based on the employee's base pay rate times the number of hours the employee would otherwise have worked on that day.

Regular part-time employees will be paid on a pro rata basis. Employees may not accrue more than 30 days of time off. Once an employee's time off balance reaches this limit, an employee may accrue more time off only by taking some time off to bring the balance back below the limit. <br />

> [!WARNING]
> When employees eligible for paid time off do not take the full amount of time off they could have taken in a year, that amount will be forfeited at the end of the year.

### Section 6.3 - Holidays

We observe the following **paid** holidays: <br />

+ Martin Luthur King Jr. Day <br />
+ President's Day <br />
+ Memorial Day <br />
+ Independence Day <br />
+ Labor Day <br />
+ Columbus Day <br />
+ Veterans Day <br />
+ Thanksgiving Day <br />
+ Christmas Eve <br />
+ Christmas Day <br />
+ New Year's Eve <br />
+ New Year's Day <br />

We will grant paid holiday time off to all eligible employees. Holiday pay for regular full-time employees will be calculated based on the employee's base pay rate (as of the date of the holiday) times the number of hours the employee would other wise have worked on that day. <br />

> [!NOTE]
> Regular [part-time employees](/employee-resources/employment-handbook/section2.md#part-time-employees) will be paid on a pro rata basis.

> [!NOTE]
> If eligible [nonexempt employees](/employee-resources/employment-handbook/section2.md#nonexempt-employees) works on a recognized holiday with our approval, they will receive holiday pay plus wages at their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday.

### Section 6.4 - Pregnancy-Disability Leave

Employees who are disabled on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical coniditon may request a paid leave of absence. <br />

Such leave will be granted for the **period of disability** up to a maxium of **six** (**6**) months. Time off may be requested for prenatal care, severe morning sickness, docter-order bed rest, childbirth, and recovery from child birth. <br />

Leave provided for pregnancy disability is treated seperate from leaves required by the state family and medical leave law. However, the first 12 work weeks of a pregnancy disability leave will be treated concurrently as leave pursuant to the federal **Family and Medical Leave Act** (**FMLA**) for all eligible employees. <br />

Employees who wish to ake a pregnancy disability leave must notify [Kyyle E. Garrow](mailto:kgarrow@devneta.org) or the Management department of the date the leave is expected to commence and the estimated duration of the leave. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The employee must also provide medical certification of disability to us. <br />
> Failure to provide the required medical certification of disability to us in a timely manner will result in delay or denial of leave. 

Before returning to work, the employee must provide a medical certification that she is able to resume her original job duties. Appropriate forms may be obtained from [Kyyle E. Garrow](mailto:kgarrow@devneta.org) or the Management department. <br />
