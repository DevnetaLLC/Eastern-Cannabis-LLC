## Section 6 - Leaves of Absence and Time Off

### Section 6.1 - General

While regular attendance is crucial to maintain business operations, we recognize that, for a variety of reasons, employees may need time off from work. <br />

We have available a number of types of leaves of absence. Some are governed by law, and others are discretionary. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For all planned leaves, employees must submit a request at least **fourteen** (**14**) days in advance. In case of emergencies, employees should submit the request as soon as they become aware of the need for leave.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All leaves must have the approval of [Kyyle E. Garrow](mailto:kgarrow@devneta.org) and, or the Management department.

If during a leave, an employee accepts another job, engages in other employment or consulting outside of the Company, or applies for unemployment insurance benefits, the employee may be considered to have voluntarily resigned from employment with the Company. <br />

All requests for leave of absence will be considered in light of their effect on us and our work requirements, as determined by [Kyyle E. Garrow](mailto:kgarrow@devneta.org) and, or the Management department, which reserves the right to approve or deny requests in their sole discretion, unless otherwise required by law. <br />

> [!NOTE]
> For disability-related leave requests, we will engage in an interactive process with the employee to determine if leave is the most appropriate accommodation. <br />
> Employees must provide a certification from their healthcare provider to us to support leave for medical reasons.

> [!WARNING]
> Failure to provide the required certification to us in a timely manner will result in delay or denial of leave

If an employee requires an extension of leave, the employee must request such extension and have it approved before the expiration of the currently approved leave. <br />

_While we will make a reasonable effort to return the employee to their former position or comparable position following an approved leave of absence, there is no guarantee that the employee will be reinstated to their position, or any position, expect as required by law._ <br />

### Section 6.2 - Paid Time Off Days

Eligible employees are entitled to **twenty-one** (**21**) paid time off ("_PTO_") days per year. <br />

> [!NOTE]
> A PTO days' pay for regular [full-time employees](/employee-resources/employment-handbook/section2.md#full-time-employees) will be calculated based on the employee's base pay rate times the number of hours the employee would otherwise have worked on that day.

Regular part-time employees will be paid on a pro rata basis. Employees may not accrue more than 30 days of time off. Once an employee's time off balance reaches this limit, an employee may accrue more time off only by taking some time off to bring the balance back below the limit. <br />

> [!WARNING]
> When employees eligible for paid time off do not take the full amount of time off they could have taken in a year, that amount will be forfeited at the end of the year.

### Section 6.3 - Holidays

We observe the following **paid** holidays: <br />

+ Martin Luthur King Jr. Day <br />
+ President's Day <br />
+ Memorial Day <br />
+ Independence Day <br />
+ Labor Day <br />
+ Columbus Day <br />
+ Veterans Day <br />
+ Thanksgiving Day <br />
+ Christmas Eve <br />
+ Christmas Day <br />
+ New Year's Eve <br />
+ New Year's Day <br />

We will grant paid holiday time off to all eligible employees. Holiday pay for regular full-time employees will be calculated based on the employee's base pay rate (as of the date of the holiday) times the number of hours the employee would other wise have worked on that day. <br />

> [!NOTE]
> Regular [part-time employees](/employee-resources/employment-handbook/section2.md#part-time-employees) will be paid on a pro rata basis.

> [!NOTE]
> If eligible [nonexempt employees](/employee-resources/employment-handbook/section2.md#nonexempt-employees) works on a recognized holiday with our approval, they will receive holiday pay plus wages at their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday.

### Section 6.4 - Pregnancy-Disability Leave

Employees who are disabled on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical coniditon may request a paid leave of absence. <br />

Such leave will be granted for the **period of disability** up to a maxium of **six** (**6**) months. Time off may be requested for prenatal care, severe morning sickness, docter-order bed rest, childbirth, and recovery from child birth. <br />

Leave provided for pregnancy disability is treated seperate from leaves required by the state family and medical leave law. However, the first 12 work weeks of a pregnancy disability leave will be treated concurrently as leave pursuant to the federal **Family and Medical Leave Act** (**FMLA**) for all eligible employees. <br />

Employees who wish to ake a pregnancy disability leave must notify [Kyyle E. Garrow](mailto:kgarrow@devneta.org) or the Management department of the date the leave is expected to commence and the estimated duration of the leave. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The employee must also provide medical certification of disability to us. <br />
> Failure to provide the required medical certification of disability to us in a timely manner will result in delay or denial of leave. 

Before returning to work, the employee must provide a medical certification that she is able to resume her original job duties. Appropriate forms may be obtained from [Kyyle E. Garrow](mailto:kgarrow@devneta.org) or the Management department. <br />

> [!NOTE]
> Employees who return to work immediately following the expiration of an approved pregnancy disability leave will be generally reemployed in their former position or a comparable job, as required by law.

Employees who are affected by pregnancy may also be eligible to transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position or duties, provided certain prerequisities are met. Reasonable accomodations may be requested with the advice of the employee's healthcare provider. In addition, lactation accommodations is also available, upon request.

### Section 6.5 - Family and Medical Leave

Eligible employees may request a family and medical leave of absence under the federal **Family Medical Leave Act** (**FMLA**) in the circumstances described below. Eligible employees are those who have been employed by us for at least twelve (12) months, have worked at least one-thousand two-hundred and fifty (1,250) hours during the twelve (12) months immediately prior to the family and medical leave of absence, and are employed at a worksite were there are fifty (50) or more employees of the Company within seventy-five (75) miles. <br />

Employees must request planned family and medical leave at least thirty (30) days before the leave begins. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, employees must request the leave as soon as they become aware of the need for leave. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in the delay in the start of the leave. <br />

A family and medical leave may be taken for the following reasons: <br />


+ the birth of an employee's child or the placement of a child with the employee for foster care or adoption, so long as the leave is completed within two (2) months of the birth or placement of the child; <br /> 
+ the care of the employee's spouse or registered domestic partner, child, or parent with a "serious health condition" <br />
+ the "serious health condition" of the employee; <br />
+ because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, child, or parents is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty, in the Armed Forces in support of a contingency operation; or <br />
+ to care for a covered service member (who is the employee's spouse, child, parent, or next of kin) with a serious illness or injury. <br />

A "serious health condition" is one that requires inpatient care in a hospital or other medical care facility or continuing treatment or supervision by a health care provider. A "covered service member" is a member of the Armed Forces (including National Guard or Reserves) who is the employee's spouse, child, parents or next of kin, and is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty. A "serious illness or injury" is an injury or illness incurred in the line of duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render the member medically unfit to preform the duties of the member's office, grade, rank, or rating. <br />

### Medical Certification

When leave is requested for medical reasons, the employee must submit a medical certification from the health care provider that establishes the employee is eligible for family and medical leave. This certification must be provided as soon as is reasonably practical, and not later than the date leave begins or within 15 days of our request, whichever is later. When the leave is requested because of the employee's own serious health condition, the certification must include: <br />

1. the date the serious health condition commenced, <br />
2. the probable duration of the serious health condition, and <br />
3. a statement that, because of the serious health condition, the employee is unable to work or needs medical treatment. <br />

When leave is requested for a family member who is ill or injuried, the certification must contain: <br />

1. verification the family member has a serious health condition or serious injury or illness, as defined above, and the date such condition began, <br />
2. the probable duration of the condition, <br />
3. an estimate of the amount of time the health care provider believes the employee will be needed to care for the family member or covered service member, and <br />
4. a statement that the condition warrants the participation of the employee to provide care. <br />

> [!WARNING]
> We reserve the right to contact the health care provider to seek clarification of information in the certification, as needed, and may request re-certification, as appropriate. <br />

Before returning to work at the conclusion of leave due to the employee's own serious health condition, the employee is required to provide a certification from their healthcare provider regarding the employee's fitness for duty. The employee must provide the required medical certification to us in a timely manner to avoid a delay or denial of leave. <br />

Family and medical leave may be taken for up to twelve (12) work weeks during the designated twelve (12) month period for the purpose described above. The twelve (12) month period will be calculated based on a calendar year. Leave for the purpose described in 5, above (to care for a covered service member), may be taken for up to twenty-six (26) work weeks in a single twelve (12) month period. During the single twelve (12) month period, an eligible employee shall be entitled to a combined total of twenty-six (26) work weeks of leave for the reasons specified in paragraphs 1-4 above (up to twelve (12) weeks), will be counted towards the total twenty-six (26) week entitlement permitted for leave to cared for a _covered service member_ with a serious illness or injury during the single twelve (12) month period. All time off that qualifies as family and medical leave will be counted against the employee's federal and, if applicable, state family and medical leave entitlement to the fullest extent permitted by law. <br />

> [!NOTE]
> During a family and medical leave, group benefits will be maintained for up to twelve (12) work weeks (or up to twenty-six (26) work weeks when leave is for the purpose of caring for a covered service member), as if the employee was continously employed. <br />

> [!WARNING]
> If the employee does not return to work onthe frst workday following the expiration of an approved family and medical leave, the employee will be deemed to have resigned from their employment. 

Upon returning from such leave the employee will normally be reinstated to their original or equivalent position and will receive pay and benefits equivalent to those the employee received prior to the leave, as required by law. <br />

> [!WARNING]
> In certain circumstances, "key" employees may not be eligible for reinstatement following a family and medical leave. We will provide written notice to any "key
 employee who is not eligible fo reinstatement. <br />

Any employee who is unableto work due to a work-related injury or illness and who is eligible for Workers' Compensation benefits will be provided an unpaid leave for the period required.
